# Rails API Project

This is a fast and straightforward project that sets up a Ruby on Rails application as a data-producing API. Instead of rendering HTML, all controller actions are designed to return data (typically JSON), making this a pure RESTful resource.

## Purpose

This project serves as practice for:

- Creating a Rails application with an API-only focus
- Building RESTful routes and controllers
- Rendering structured data instead of HTML
- Preparing for future projects that interact with external APIs

## Notes

- No external API integrations are used in this project.
- All logic is handled within the app using standard Rails conventions.
